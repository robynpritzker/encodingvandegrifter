  <p>A weak minded <span
class="persName">sheep</span> and her lamb once lived on a bit of barren land; there were several
small spots where clover grew, and a little shelter of old brush. They were not well cared for, but
they made the best of what they had, and were reasonably happy. One day a she wolf brought over to
their place, from her own green fields, several sheep from her flock; they devoured all the clover
that was the only <span class="overstrike">subsistence</span><span class="add">⟨sustenance⟩</span>
of the <span class="persName">sheep</span> and lamb, and carelessly threw over their shelter of
boughs.</p><p>It sounds odd that a she-wolf should have charge of a flock; but this was a wily she-
wolf; there were many wolves in the forest, and game was scarce and shy, so she got a place with a
shepherd as a sheepdog. The shepherd was blind, and old, and foolish, and never knew the imposture.
The neighbours, who were reluctant to meddle in other people’s affairs, did not like, or did not
choose to tell him; so the she-wolf and her cubs waxed fast and strong, while her kinsmen of the
forest, gaunt and hungry roamed <span class="pagebreak"
id="index.xml-pb-w221547ab2b3b1b3b5b1"></span> about, seeking their prey.</p><p>It was not
that she particularly wished to harm the <span class="persName">sheep</span> and lamb that the
she-wolf robbed them, but that her natural instincts inclining her to a guerrilla life occasionally
overcame the teachings of civilization.</p><p>It was hard upon the <span
class="persName">sheep</span> and the lamb. A cold rain fell, and winter was not far off. Before the
clover had started to grow again, the shivering lamb was dead. The sheep tried to warm it with her
own body, but her wool was wet, and she, too, was starved with the cold; she could only watch her
lamb’s innocent eyes grey, and its little legs stiffen, with a breaking heart. She could do nothing;
she could not replace the shelter, nor could she make the grass grow again, though she would gladly
have watered the grass with her blood, and torn the fleece from her back to keep the cold from the
lamb.</p><p>When the lamb was dead it was thrown into a hole. The <span class="persName">sheep,
</span> in her grief, hoped and thought she might die too; but she was older and stronger and more
used to hardship than the lamb, so, sad and lonely, she held on and endured the cold and the hunger.
Most of the time she either stood gazing <span class="pagebreak"
id="index.xml-pb-w221547ab2b3b1b3c11b1b3"></span>at the hole where they had thrown her lamb,
or wandered about the bare pasture where it had frisked and played in happier days. Once a cub of
the she-wolf came that way; it was so plump, and sleek, and well cared for, that when the bereaved
sheep looked upon it she felt her weak heart giving way because of the injustice of things, and in a
mad rage chased the wolf-cub howling away to its mother.</p><p>The next day the blind shepherd came
in a great rage to the <span class="persName">sheep. </span> The wolf-cub had come panting home with
a fearful tale; the <span class="persName">sheep,</span> she said, had come at her with a mouth a
yard wide, full of blood and foam; with eyes the size of dinner plates, from which shot blue and
green flames, and with an awful, deafening roar like a wild lion.</p><p>The <span
class="persName">sheep</span> could not remember these details, but full of trouble went off alone
to think it over; and wondered if all this were really true, and she had actually become a <span>mad
ravening sheep</span>.</p><p>Soon she met the <span class="persName">Haymaker</span> who was fond of
walking in paths and places where the shadows were heavy. He was called the <span
class="persName">Haymaker</span> because he was supposed to make hay while the sun shone. All people
went to him for advice, he was <span class="pagebreak"
id="index.xml-pb-w221547ab2b3b1b3c17b5">[Page]</span>accounted so very wise; he was thought to be
wise because he had many books, and he looked solemn, and he often said “policy is better than
honesty,” “don’t whistle too much for your pay,” and other things that showed a profound intellect,
and a habit of deep thought. When he demanded the reason of the <span
class="persName">sheep’s</span> depression of mind, she, being in awe of so great a man, <span
class="said">‘told her story’</span>.</p><div class="said">“I must tell you what to do,” said
he.</div><div class="said">“Oh no!” cried <span>the sheep</span> “you are so very respectable that
it would never do that you should mix yourself up in the affairs of a silly sheep, and a beast of
prey.”</div><p>The <span class="persName">Haymaker</span> <span class="said">‘insisted that she
listen to him, and be guided by him.’</span></p><p><span class="said">‘“But I know myself what is
best for me,” cried the <span class="persName">sheep.</span> “Let me go away off to some quiet place
where I can be quite alone. There I may be able to recover my former tranquility of mind. As it is,
I fear I am in too dangerous a state to be allowed to roam about freely. It is a dreadful thing to
find out that one is a ravening sheep. How do I know, or how do you know, to what wild deed my
fevered mind may prompt me. Suppose I should suddenly spring upon the wild bull, drag him to 
  <span
class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-w221547ab2b3b1b3c25ab3">
  </span>the ground, and tear his
vitals from his quivering body."’</span> </p><div class="said">“That would, indeed, be horrible,”
said the <span class="persName">Haymaker;</span> “but worse yet than that may happen.”</div><div
class="said">“Worse than that!” Cried the <span class="persName">sheep</span> in an awe-stricken
voice.</div><div class="said">“Yes; there is a lower depth still,” and he spoke in a voice as hollow
and ghastly that a thrill went through the veins of the sheep, and chilled her very heart.</div><div
class="said">“Suppose the pigs and the grasshoppers should find it out?”</div><p>With a cry of
horror the sheep fell swooning upon the ground. <span class="said">‘She had never thought of that.
In her ignorance and stupidity she had thought nothing could be worse than to know one’s self to be
a ravening sheep; but oh heavens! That the pigs and the grasshoppers should
know!’</span></p><p>Crushed and humiliated she was carried off to a small paddock by the sea; here
she nibbled grass on the hillside, and trotted by the beach, and might have become reasonable,
cheerful in her latter days, but for the awful dread that always lay like a stone in her heart,
“Suppose the pigs and the grasshoppers should know.”</p>
  <p>The <span
class="persName">Haymaker</span> came in time to dislike all thought or mention of the <span
class="persName">sheep;</span> for he, too, was terrified lest the pigs and grasshoppers should
know, and it should be whispered about that a man as staid and respectable as he had once known a
ravening sheep.</p>
