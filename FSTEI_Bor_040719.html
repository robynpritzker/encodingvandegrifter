How it happened is not part of this story, which opens with <span class="persName"></span>Belinda hanging by the belt on a hook in a giant’s kitchen. </p><p>The cook was heating water, and sharpening knives for the evident purpose of preparing the unhappy girl for the giant’s table, she was just in the act of studying <span class="persName"></span>Belinda’s length and breadth with an eye to a dripping pan of the right proportions when the giant entered.</p><p><span class="persName"></span>Belinda could see nothing in her terror but a huge unshapely bulk of frightful aspect.  Really, however, <span class="persName"></span>the giant possessed a jolly, big good-humoured stupid face. Jolly people are apt to be a little stupid.</p><p><span class="said">‘“No luck again, today.”’</span> He said, as he came thumping in. <span class="said">‘“A pretty dish to sit before the grand Borriballoo, one pitiful child with a spoonful of gravy; and too late today for any more hunting. Is she nice and plump?”’</span> as he advanced toward the terrified Belinda.</p><p><span class="said">‘“Halloo! What’s this?!’</span>  Stooping to pick up a bit of paper that had dropped from <span class="persName"></span>Belinda’s pocket. As he glanced over the note, which was only a wash bill from Belinda’s mother, who did clearstacking, his countenance changed; he sighed heavily, and <span class="said">‘’</span> repeated the name signed to the note several times in a sad and touching voice; then reached up and unhooked <span class="persName"></span>Belinda whom he placed upon a table by his side.</p><p><span class="said">‘“What is your name, child?”’</span> he asked, in a very different voice from that he had used when he entered. <span class="persName"></span> <span class="said">‘“Belinda Smith, you say? Ah yes, that name I have heard before. It is truly a sweet name. You would hardly believe now, that a bluff old fellow like myself had ever been in love? I have. It was your mother child. Many years ago she fell into my hands much as you have done; I had intended her for company, but before long she had <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-w5891905ab2b3b1b1c13b4b3">[Page]</span>somehow wound herself into my affections, she implored me to carry her to her father. I did so. From that day to this I have never beheld her. I know now that it would have been better to have eaten her as I intended to do, for then she would have been part of my own being forever. Now it is too late. Like you, she was very plump,”’</span> looking dreamily at <span class="persName"></span>Belinda.</p><div class="said">“I think, my dear, for the sake of old times, and the memories of my youth, I will have you served with my guests instead of to them. Come, I will call <span class="persName"></span>Lallagagog, my son to show you to the guest chamber. Try to rest and sleep well that your eyes may be as bright, and your cheeks as rosy as your mothers were when I first saw her.”</div><p><span class="persName"></span>Lallagagog came at <span class="said">‘his father’s call ’</span> and escorted <span class="persName"></span>Belinda to her room. He was a saucy awkward lout of a giant boy and disposed to be sulky at the change in the morrow’s bill of fare.</p><p><span class="persName"></span>Belinda was too tired to think of the strange things that had occurred, and <span class="said">‘begging <span class="persName"></span>Lallagagog to reach a pillow for her from the immense bed,’</span> she lay down upon it and slept until daybreak. In the morning it was some time before she could recall her scattered senses enough to recollect her whereabouts; but <span class="persName"></span>Lallagagog’s hoarse voice <span class="said">‘calling her to breakfast,’</span> warned her to be in haste. She dressed rapidly and stepped into the hall where <span class="persName"></span>the giant was waiting for her. He led her into the breakfast room. A box had been placed upon a chair for her and the giant lifted her to her place. Her acutest fears now began to dissipate, and she ate her breakfast with a good appetite, and even <span class="said">‘carried on a conversation with the giant with some diplomacy, giving full accounts of all the members of the Smith family’</span> that she knew anything about, especially of those who had become famous or possessed much political influence, hoping that the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-w5891905ab2b3b1b1c19c12">[Page]</span> <span class="persName"></span>giant might have some fear of incurring the enmity of so great and influential a race.</p><p>The giant listened politely, and looked impressed by what she had said. Suddenly a bright idea seemed to strike him.</p><p><span class="persName"></span><span class="said">‘“Belinda,”’</span> said he kindly, <span class="said">‘“How old are you?’</span></p><div class="said">“Fifteen.”</div><p>“My grandmother was married at fifteen,” remarked <span class="persName"></span>the giant.</p><p>“Was she indeed?” said Belinda, not knowing what else to say.</p><p><span class="persName"></span>“Belinda,” more kindly still, “How would you like to be married?”</p><p>A horrible fear took possession of <span class="persName"></span>Belinda. Perhaps he wished to marry her himself. He must be a widower, she had seen no woman, yet, about the house but the cook, and for all she knew, giants might, anyhow, have as many wives as old <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Brigham-Young">Brigham.</a></p><p>“I—I don’t—know” faltered poor <span class="persName"></span>Belinda, bursting into tears.</p><p>“Tut, tut, Pshaw!” said <span class="persName"></span>the giant in not so kind a voice as before. “I’m not going to eat you, what are you crying for?”</p><p>The cry was swallowed instantly, as <span class="persName"></span>Belinda made haste to answer “I never thought of such a thing, I assure you! What were you about to say, please?” with a sickly attempt to smile.</p><p>“Only this,” said <span class="persName"></span>the giant, “that I am going to have company today to dinner; a personnage of great importance;” his voice took a deeper tone. “His Highness the <span class="persName"></span>Grand Borriballoo! It is to be quite an affair as it is only a business interview he seeks. “I,” and he swelled with conscious pride, “am Confidential Matrimonial Adviser to his highness! Of course a personage of his rank could not take the trouble to choose a wife for himself. That is my affair.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-w5891905ab2b3b1b1c41b5">[Page]</span> I have been in much perplexity because I could not fix upon an eligible party, when it suddenly occurred to me, why not <span class="persName"></span>Belinda? You are certainly of a good family, belonging to a long line of Smiths. And being a protegee of mine gives you standing. Indeed, I consider it a very suitable match on both sides. Now, my dear, just think this matter over. At four precisely I will come for your decision.” Bowing politely he left the room.</p><p>Belinda was in a whirl of agitation. What a brilliant future was before her! The <span class="persName"></span>Borriballoo, might, to be sure, be as old and ugly as the giant himself: but the bliss of being “My Lady Borriballoo” covered any unpleasant suggestions that arose in her mind. An occasional thought of the red headed boy, who sat next to her at school, and to whom she had been engaged for the past three weeks came to her remembrance once or twice, but was soon forgotten. What chance had a red headed boy beside the grand <span class="persName"></span>Borriballoo.</p><p><span class="persName"></span>Belinda had one ugly habit of which I am loth to speak. She was very apt to put her thumb in her mouth when thinking. She did so upon this occasion, as she sat wrapped in her reflections, <span class="persName"></span>Lallagagog, who had been drowning flies in the cream, and amusing himself in other kindred ways, now turned his attention to <span class="persName"></span>Belinda, stepping up softly behind her, he placed one great hand upon her head, the other under her chin, and suddenly snapped her teeth together with a loud laugh.</p><p><span class="persName"></span>Lallagagog did a worse mischief than he had intended. His hands were so strong, and the little white teeth so sharp, that <span class="persName"></span>Belinda was placed in the awkward predicament of having bitten off her own thumb.</p><p><span class="persName"></span>Lallagagog ran off and hid himself, and poor <span class="persName"></span>Belinda retired, weeping, to her chamber to bind up her mutilated hand <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-w5891905ab2b3b1b1c49b4">[Page]</span>and invent an excuse for not appearing at dinner; for she hardly liked to make her first appearance before the <span class="persName"></span>Borriballoo with a red nose and swollen eyes, and a bandaged hand.</p><p>She finally pleaded a headache, a feeling of uncertainty and insecurity prompting her not to complain of <span class="persName"></span>Lallagagog.</p><p>When <span class="persName"></span>the giant saw her woebegone face, he very readily excused her, saying that if such was her pleasure, he would make all necessary arrangements himself.</p><p>Ambition and pride rose in <span class="persName"></span>Belinda’s heart, she gave her full consent to the proposed marriage.</p><p>In the evening, the giant said that the grand <span class="persName"></span>Borriballoo was perfectly satisfied with the description and account given of the bride elect, and only desired that she should be allowed to remain in strict seclusion until the day of the ceremony, in accordance with the customs of his ancestors.</p><p>Preparations for the wedding went on apace, and at length the day arrived. The great hall of <span class="persName"></span>the giant’s mansion was decorated with the most elegant taste, and hundreds of brilliant lights flashed upon the jewels and rich dresses of the guests.</p><p>At opposite ends of the hall were great doors. These were thrown open simultaneously. Through one entered the <span class="persName"></span>Grand Borriballoo leaning upon the arm of the priest, at the same moment that <span class="persName"></span>Belinda supported by <span class="persName"></span>the giant appeared at the other. <span class="persName"></span>Lallagagog followed bearing her train.</p><p>All eyes were turned towards <span class="persName"></span>the bride; but she saw nothing but the <span class="persName"></span>Grand Borriballoo, whom she now met for the first time. His carriage was majestic, and at the same time of a very peculiar grace, caused doubtless by his having three legs, instead of the usual number. His glittering tail was so <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-w5891905ab2b3b1b1c63b5">[Page]</span>long that as he stood in the centre of the room its extremity reached to the entrance where it was borne by five and twenty pages in gold and white. His heavy locks of ferns and field flowers fell to his waist. His eye, placed in the centre of his forehead, was large and lustrous and full. In short, the most fastidious person could have taken no exception to his personal appearance.</p><p>A sudden hush and expectant thrill fell upon the vast assembly as the <span class="persName"></span>grand Borriballoo advanced towards <span class="persName"></span>Belinda, tenderly took her hand, gazed long and earnestly into her face, and signed the priest to continue. Why will not the fates allow me to stop here, nor further follow this tale which so suddenly changes to a scene of gloom and horror.</p><p>As <span class="persName"></span>Belinda, blushing, raised her hand to receive the ring from the <span class="persName"></span>Royal Borriballoo, the priest gently said “Your right thumb, if you please; it is the law that only thus a grand <span class="persName"></span>Borriballoo may marry.</p><p>Unconsciously <span class="persName"></span>Belinda raised her maimed right hand.</p><p>The priest shrank back with a cry of horror, and the <span class="persName"></span>Grand Borriballoo fell to the floor in a deathlike swoon.</p><p>“Ah I shall burst with mortification!” Groaned <span class="persName"></span>the giant, which he immediately did with a loud report.</p><p>The guests fled in terror, some of them mortally wounded.</p><p>The ring, which had dropped from the hand of the bridegroom rolled along the floor to the feet of <span class="persName"></span>Lallagagog, who shyly hid it in his mouth. It stuck in his windpipe. In the confusion caused by his father’s explosion he was unnoticed, and soon choked to death.</p><p>The whole proceedings were so frightfully indecorous that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-w5891905ab2b3b1b1c79b1">[Page]</span>the priest fell into a rage, which was so deep that no ropes would reach him, where he remains to this day.</p><p>The end of the <span class="persName"></span>grand Borriballoo was sad beyond belief. Knowing his union with <span class="persName"></span>Belinda was now impossible, he fell into a low state, weeping incessantly, neglecting the affairs connected with his rank and office, which consequently fell into other hands about whom his old friends rallied.</p><p>His society had become so wearisome to those about him that he was left alone more and more, so that when he had wept his eye out so one was aware of the piteous fact, and he wandered for days in a thick wood adjacent to the castle vainly seeking his way out. At last, glum and weary, suffering intolerably from thirst and hunger, he sunk upon the ground.</p><p>“Ah <span class="persName"></span>Belinda” moaned he, as he wiped the growing cavern where his eye had been, with his tail, “would I had never beheld thee!” In his anguish he accidentally placed the end of his tail into his mouth; unconsciously, in his delirium, assailed by the pangs of hunger, he began devouring it, and absently ate himself up. No remains were ever found except a few tail scales that his stomach was unable to digest.</p><p>As to <span class="persName"></span>Belinda, no one knows what became of her.</p></div><!--TEI back--><div class="editorial" id="index.xml-back.1_div.1"><h2><span class="headingNumber">Appendix A </span></h2><ul xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li></li><li><span class="persName">Belinda Smith</span><span class="">human</span></li><li><span class="persName">Lallagagog</span><span class="">giant</span></li><li><span class="persName">the Giant</span><span class="">giant</span></li><li><span class="persName">Grand Borriballoo</span><span class="">humanoid creature</span>flowers for hair, long glittering tail, three legs</li><li><span class="persName">Sheep</span><span class="">Sheep</span></li><li><span class="persName">Lamb</span></li><li><span class="persName">she-wolf</span></li></ul>indicating a character's display of grief, sadness, loss.indicating a character's display of fear, anger, terror, distress.indicating a character's display of joy, happiness.indicating a character's display of uncertainty, mistrust, or confusion.Relating to themes, trends, conventions of the Gothic genre.Relating to themes, trends, conventions of the wonder tale genre.</div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Fanny Van de Grift Stevenson.
